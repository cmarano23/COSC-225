    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>I am currently a <em>senior</em> at <strong>Amherst College</strong> studying Computer Science and Astronomy/Physics.</p>
    <h3>Biographical Sketch</h3>
    <p>Before coming to Amherst, I grew up in Philadelphia, PA. Here is a brief description of my life before enrolling in Amherst College:
        I was born and raised just outside of Philadelphia in <strong>Jenkintown, PA</strong>. I went to <strong>William Penn Charter School</strong>, where I graduated in June of 2019.
        I applied <strong>early decision</strong> to Amherst in the fall of 2018, and was very excited to be accepted that December! I was always interested in computers, and fell in love with <strong>Computer Science</strong> when I got to Amherst.
    <p>I will be graduating Amherst College in May of 2023. Upon graduation, I will be moving to Denver, CO to return as a software engineer at Sierra Space (<em>where I interned over the Summer of 2022</em>).
        Last summer, I had to opportunity to work on the Flight Software team for the Dreamchaser 100 spaceplane that will be taking its inaugural flight sometime in 2023. I had an amazing experience and was able to get valuable hands-on work as a software engineer.
        I am extremely passionate about the aerospace industry and I am excited to be able to work at a company where I get to explore my passions. In addition, I am excited to move out West to Denver and begin a new chapter of my life!
